This Lava River pack is a collection of assets to create a realistic lava river.

Load the Lava_River.unity for an example scene, or drag your required river Prefab (Riverbed_Straight.prefab, Riverbed_Bend_A.prefab or Riverbed_Bend_B.prefab) from the Project window into the Hierarchy window. Note that these assets are tileable, so you can create a river to the shape and length that you require (hold down the "v" key when moving assets to snap them together).

Additional assets are in the Prefab folder to dress your scene further such as trees and rocks.

To add some dramatic uplighting from the river, don't forget to include the Lava_Uplights prefab in your scene (it can be placed anywhere in the environment).

Have fun!
